        Undertook an independent initiative to design and develop a website for
        OPI, a distinguished consulting firm. This endeavor allowed me to
        explore both design and development aspects, contributing to a holistic
        digital solution. <br />
        <br />
        ðŸ”¹ Personally conceptualized and shaped the UI and UX, prioritizing an
        intuitive and visually appealing user experience. <br />
        ðŸ”¹ Incorporated ReactJS and GSAP to introduce subtle animations,
        enhancing user interaction and engagement. <br />
        ðŸ”¹ Employed TailwindCSS for functional design and styling, creating a
        modern and user-friendly interface. <br />
        ðŸ”¹ Ensured full responsiveness across a range of screens, aiming to
        provide consistent user experiences. <br />
        ðŸ”¹ The resultant website reflects the firm's values and services,
        underscoring the synergy of innovation and professionalism. <br />
        ðŸ”¹ For a firsthand experience, the project can be explored at
        opi-new-dev.vercel.app. <br />
        <br />
        This personal project underscores my dedication to delivering meaningful
        outcomes, highlighting my growing proficiency in UI/UX design and
        front-end development, with an emphasis on crafting inclusive digital
        experiences.
